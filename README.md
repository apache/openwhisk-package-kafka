This project is an OpenWhisk package that allows you to communicate with Kafka or IBM Message Hub instances.

## Status
This is still very much a work-in-progress. So far a feed provider service and feed action have been implemented. These allow you to create a trigger that fires when new messages are posted to the Kafka instance/topic provided. While this technically works, the current state is still "alpha" quality, and should only be used for kicking the tires.
